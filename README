      ADVENTURE_CAD : a simple polygon-based solid modeler


OVERVIEW

Adventure CAD is a C++ CAD library and command-line tool for 3D solid modeling 
and mesh generation. It provides polygon-based geometric modeling with support 
for boolean operations and automatic triangular mesh generation for finite 
element analysis.

The core functionality includes:
- 3D solid modeling using sheets, extrusions, and boolean operations
- Constrained Delaunay triangulation for surface mesh generation
- Modern C++17 error handling with exception-based error reporting
- Automatic mesh size optimization tools
- Support for various output formats (.pch, .pcm)



BUILD SYSTEM

Adventure CAD supports both traditional Makefile and modern CMake build systems:

## CMake Build (Recommended)

The modern CMake build system provides cross-platform compatibility, better 
IDE integration, and systematic dependency management:

```bash
# Clean build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4

# The executable will be at: build/command/advcad
```

CMake Build Features:
- Automatic source file discovery and dependency management
- C++17 standard compliance with proper compiler flags
- Debug/Release build configurations
- Optional debug output control (-DWH_DEBUG_ENABLED=ON)
- Automated testing targets
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Modern IDE integration (VS Code, CLion, Visual Studio)

CMake Build Options:
```bash
# Debug build with debug output enabled
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWH_DEBUG_ENABLED=ON ..

# Release build (optimized)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

# Run custom test target
make test_advcad
```

## Traditional Makefile Build

For compatibility, the original Makefile system is maintained:

1. Compile WH libraries:
   ```bash
   cd WH/
   make
   ```

2. Compile ADVENTURE CAD commands:
   ```bash
   cd command/
   make
   ```

3. Install ADVENTURE CAD commands:
   Copy the executable file, advcad, to any executable directory, such as ~/bin. 
   If necessary, modify your path environment variable.

For custom builds, modify these Makefile variables:
- WH_HEADER_DIR  : the directory of WH header files
- WH_LIBRARY_DIR : the directory of WH archive files



BASIC USAGE

Usage: advcad geometry_file patch_file patch_size [-pcm]

Arguments:
  geometry_file   Input file in .gm3d format
  patch_file      Output mesh file (.pch or .pcm format)
  patch_size      Target edge length for triangular mesh elements
  -pcm           Optional: output in PCM format instead of PCH

Examples:
  % advcad sample/block.gm3d output.pch 2.0
  % advcad complex_model.gm3d mesh.pcm 0.5 -pcm

The .gm3d format supports geometric modeling commands:
  sheet N x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ...    Define a polygonal face with N vertices
  extrude dx dy dz                  Extrude previous sheet by vector (dx,dy,dz)
  subtract                          Boolean subtraction operation

Sample files are provided in the sample/ directory.



MESH SIZE SELECTION AND GEOMETRY SCALE

Adventure CAD's geometric algorithms are robust across different coordinate 
units (millimeters, meters, inches, etc.). However, proper mesh size selection 
relative to your geometry's feature sizes is critical to avoid segmentation 
faults and ensure successful triangulation.

KEY PRINCIPLE: Mesh size must be appropriate for geometric feature scales

The fundamental issue is not the coordinate unit, but the relationship between:
- Mesh size parameter (patch_size)
- Smallest geometric features in your model
- Overall model dimensions

MESH SIZE GUIDELINES:

1. **Feature-Relative Sizing**: Mesh size should be proportional to the 
   smallest significant features in your geometry:
   - Too large: May skip important geometric details
   - Too small: Can cause numerical instability and segmentation faults

2. **Recommended Starting Point**: Begin with mesh size = 10-20% of major 
   geometric features, then refine as needed:
   ```
   Model with 10mm features  → Start with patch_size = 1.0 to 2.0
   Model with 0.01m features → Start with patch_size = 0.001 to 0.002
   ```

3. **Example Scale Relationships**:
   - Millimeter model (0-100mm range): patch_size = 1.0 to 10.0
   - Meter model (0-1m range): patch_size = 0.01 to 0.1
   - Small part (0-0.02m range): patch_size = 0.001 to 0.004

COMMON ISSUES:

Using inappropriate mesh sizes may cause:
- Segmentation faults (usually from mesh size too fine for geometry)
- "Mixed triangle with real and dummy points" errors
- Triangulation failures on complex models
- Poor mesh quality or empty output files

SOLUTIONS:

1. **Use the mesh optimizer** (recommended):
   ```
   python3 optimize_mesh_size.py model.gm3d output.pch
   ```
   This automatically finds appropriate mesh sizes for your geometry.

2. **Manual mesh size selection**:
   - Start with larger mesh sizes and gradually decrease
   - Monitor output for warnings about mixed triangles
   - If segmentation faults occur, increase mesh size

3. **Scale-appropriate examples**:
   ```
   # Small mechanical part (mm scale)
   advcad small_part.gm3d output.pch 2.0
   
   # Architectural model (m scale)  
   advcad building.gm3d output.pch 0.05
   
   # Both work fine - the key is appropriate mesh size selection
   ```



MESH SIZE OPTIMIZATION

Adventure CAD includes a Python script to automatically find optimal mesh sizes:

Usage: python3 optimize_mesh_size.py geometry_file output_file

The script:
- Analyzes your geometry to estimate appropriate coordinate scale
- Tests multiple mesh sizes from coarse to fine
- Finds the largest mesh size that produces successful triangulation
- Provides recommendations based on your model's feature sizes

Example:
  % python3 optimize_mesh_size.py sample/shaft/coil_01.gm3d optimized.pch
  
  Output:
  OPTIMIZATION SUCCESSFUL!
  Optimal mesh size: 0.006040
  Triangles generated: 192
  Nodes generated: 98
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  Use mesh size 0.006040 for this geometry
  This is 20.0% of the total model size

This tool is especially useful for:
- Complex geometries with multiple feature scales
- Models where manual mesh size selection fails
- Understanding the relationship between mesh size and model scale



MODERNIZATION AND ERROR HANDLING

Adventure CAD has been modernized with C++17 features:

Exception-Based Error Handling:
- WH_Exception: Base exception class for all Adventure CAD errors
- WH_NullPointerException: Null pointer access errors
- WH_BoundsException: Array bounds violations
- WH_InvalidArgumentException: Invalid parameter errors

The modernization replaces legacy WH_ASSERT macros with proper exception 
handling, making the code more robust and easier to debug. Bounds checking 
has been added throughout the triangulation algorithms to catch geometric 
algorithm failures early.

Debug Output Control:
- CMake: Add -DWH_DEBUG_ENABLED=ON during cmake configuration
- Makefile: Add -DWH_DEBUG_ENABLED to compiler flags
- By default, debug output is disabled for clean operation
- The mesh optimizer script automatically filters debug messages



DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

For developers working on Adventure CAD:

1. **CMake Development Setup (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build-debug && cd build-debug
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWH_DEBUG_ENABLED=ON ..
   make -j4
   
   # Run tests
   make test_advcad
   
   # Development build with optimization
   mkdir build-release && cd build-release
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j4
   ```

2. **IDE Integration**:
   - VS Code: Open folder and use CMake Tools extension
   - CLion: Open CMakeLists.txt as project
   - Visual Studio: Open Folder and use CMake support

3. **Testing**:
   The CMake system includes automated testing targets:
   ```bash
   make test_advcad      # Test with sample block geometry
   ```

4. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   make install          # Install to system directories
   ```



TROUBLESHOOTING

Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Build Issues**:
   - CMake not found: Install cmake (version 3.15+)
   - Compiler errors: Ensure C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+)
   - Missing math library: CMake automatically handles -lm linking

2. **Triangulation Failures**:
   - Use mesh size optimizer to find appropriate patch_size
   - Verify .gm3d file format is correct
   - Ensure mesh size is appropriate for geometry feature scales

3. **Segmentation Faults**:
   - MOST COMMON: Mesh size too fine relative to geometry features
   - Try larger mesh sizes (increase patch_size parameter)
   - Use mesh optimizer to find stable mesh size range
   - Check for degenerate geometry in input

4. **"Mixed triangle" Errors**:
   - Indicates constrained Delaunay triangulation failure
   - Usually caused by mesh size too large for small geometric features
   - Try smaller mesh sizes or use mesh optimizer
   - Check for very small geometric details that need finer meshes

5. **Empty Output Files**:
   - Verify input geometry file is valid
   - Check that patch_size is appropriate for model size
   - Use mesh optimizer to find working parameters

6. **Performance Issues**:
   - Very small mesh sizes generate many triangles (memory intensive)
   - Start with larger mesh sizes and refine as needed
   - Monitor output file sizes as indication of mesh density

Exit Codes:
- 0: Success
- 1: General error (algorithm failure, invalid input)
- -11: Segmentation fault (usually mesh size/scale related)
