# Zero-Length Vector Division Fix Plan

## Current Status
- **Success Rate**: 68.4% (13/19 models passing)
- **Issue**: 6 models fail with `WH_ne (ratio, 0.0)` assertion in `space2d_inline.cc:109`
- **Root Cause**: Division by zero in 2D vector operations when vectors have zero length

## Failing Models
- `test_3.gm3d`, `test_4.gm3d`, `test_7.gm3d` (CSG models)
- `shaft/air_practice.gm3d`, `shaft/air_up2_top_01.gm3d`, `shaft/cyclic_mag_body_01.gm3d` (shaft models)

All show identical pattern:
```
WARNING: Normalizing zero-length vector - returning unit X vector
...
ASSERTION "WH_ne (ratio, 0.0)" failed: file "WH/../WH/space2d_inline.cc", line 109
```

## Analysis
- **3D vectors**: Already have zero-length protection in `space3d_inline.cc`
- **2D vectors**: Missing zero-length protection in division operator
- **Pattern**: Degenerate geometry → zero-length vectors → division by zero → assertion failure

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Examine Current Code
- Read `WH/space2d_inline.cc:109` to understand the failing division operator
- Compare with working 3D protection in `WH/space3d_inline.cc`
- Identify the specific operation causing division by zero

### Step 2: Implement Zero-Length Protection
- Add zero-length check before division in 2D vector operator
- Return appropriate fallback value (similar to 3D approach)
- Consider adding warning message for consistency

### Step 3: Test Fix
- Build with changes: `cd build && make -j4`
- Test with known failing model: `test_3.gm3d` with mesh size 1.0
- Verify assertion no longer occurs
- Check output file is generated successfully

### Step 4: Validate Full Test Suite
- Run complete regression test: `python3 test_regression.py`
- Target: Improve from 68.4% to 85-100% success rate
- Document which models are fixed

### Step 5: Commit and Document
- Commit fix with descriptive message
- Update this plan with results
- Push to origin for backup

## Expected Outcome
- **Best case**: All 6 remaining models fixed → 100% success rate (19/19)
- **Likely case**: Most models fixed → 85-95% success rate (16-18/19)
- **Worst case**: Some edge cases remain → 75-80% success rate (14-15/19)

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Risk**: Changes to core geometry operations could affect working models
- **Mitigation**: Test extensively, have git backup to revert if needed
- **Fallback**: Can revert to current 68.4% success rate if issues arise

## Success Criteria
1. Zero-length vector assertion no longer occurs
2. At least 2 additional models pass (reach 79% success rate)
3. No regressions in currently working models
4. Clean build with no new warnings
