      ADVENTURE_CAD : a simple polygon-based solid modeler



INSTALLATION

1. Compile WH libraries.

Go to directory WH/.
If necessary, edit Makefile.
Type make.

If you want to have different WH install directories, 
copy all the header files (*.h) and archive files (*.a) to 
any directories you want.



2. Compile ADVENTURE CAD commands.

Go to directory command/.
If necessary, edit Makefile.
Type make.

If you want to write any program using WH from scratch, 
you can use these programs and Makefile in these sample directories 
as a template.
In addition, you will need to modify the following variables 
in the Makefile, 

WH_HEADER_DIR  : the directory of WH header files
WH_LIBRARY_DIR : the directory of WH archive files



3. Install ADVENTURE CAD commands.

Copy the executable file, advcad, to any executable directory, such as ~/bin. 
If necessary, modify your path environment variable.



4. Try ADVENTURE CAD commands (advcad) using sample data.

Go to directory sample/.
You will see sample input data, *.gm3d files.

Usage of advcad is,

% advcad  geometry_file  patch_file  patch_size [-pcm]

Here, 
<geometry_file> is the file name of any *.gm3d file (as input),
<patch_file> is the file name of any *.pch/*.pcm file (as output), 
<patch_size> is a real number, the average length of triangle patches.
[-pcm] is an option to output surface patch in the pcm format.
       if -pcm is omitted, surface patch will be output in the pch format.
