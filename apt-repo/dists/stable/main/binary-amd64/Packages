Description: Advanced CAD library for 3D solid modeling and mesh generation
 AdvCAD is a C++ CAD library for 3D solid modeling and mesh generation with
 Constrained Delaunay Triangulation. It provides robust mesh generation
 capabilities with high success rates and automatic mesh sizing.
 .
 Features:
  * Constrained Delaunay Triangulation with robust predicates
  * Automatic mesh size calculation
  * Command-line mesh generation tool
  * High-quality triangular mesh generation
  * Support for complex CSG operations
  * 97.5% success rate on stress tests
