  Next Priority Tasks:

  Priority 1: 3D Mesh Preview (Right Panel)

  Why first: Essential for CAD workflow - users need to see their geometry
  - OpenGL widget for .pch visualization
  - Basic 3D controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
  - Wireframe/solid display modes
  - Auto-refresh after mesh generation

  Priority 2: Enhanced Editor Features

  Why second: Quality of life improvements for daily use
  - Auto-completion for .gm3d commands
  - Parameter tooltips on hover
  - Line numbers in editor
  - Undo/Redo functionality (Ctrl+Z/Y)

  Priority 3: Error Validation & Feedback

  Why third: Professional tools need good error handling
  - Real-time syntax validation
  - Error squiggles for invalid operations
  - Stack validation warnings
  - Parameter range checking

  Priority 4: GenAI Chat Interface

  Why last: Advanced feature, not core CAD functionality
  - Collapsible bottom panel
  - Context-aware geometry help
  - Japanese language support

  Recommendation: Start with 3D Mesh Preview - it's the most valuable missing piece that transforms
  this from a text editor into a real CAD tool.
